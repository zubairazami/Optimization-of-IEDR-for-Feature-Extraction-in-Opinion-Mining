I just moved to Germany two months ago and bought an 07 MDX from another military member. It has everything I could want. We just returned from a week driving through the Alps and this SUV is simply amazing. Granted, I get to drive it much faster than I could in the states, but even at 120 MPH, it was rock solid. We need the AWD for the snow and the kids stay entertained with the AV system. Plenty of passing power and very comfortable on long trips. Acuras are rare in Germany and I get stares all the time by curious Bavarians wondering what kind of vehicle I have. If you are in the market for a luxury SUV for family touring, with cool tech toys to play with, MDX can't be beat. 
The separate controls for the rear passengers are awesome. I can control temp and AV from the front or switch to rear. Sound system is amazing. I will sometimes sit in the driveway and just listen. Also has a 120v outlet in console. Great for us since we live with 220v and need 120 on occasion. 
After months of careful research and test drives at BMW, Lexus, Volvo, etc. I settled on the MDX without a doubt in mind. I love the way the car handles, no stiffness or resistance in the steering or acceleration. The interior design is a little Star Trek for me, but once I figured everything out, it is a pleasure to have all the extras (XM radio, navigation, Bluetooth, backup camera, etc.)
The self-adjusting side mirrors which rotate to give you a view of the curb/lines as you back up. Makes backing into parking spaces and parallel parking a breeze, along with the back-up camera. Also a fan of the push-to-talk for my cell phone.
I'm two years into a three year lease and I love this car. The only thing I would change would be the shape of the grill...THAT'S IT. Everything else is perfect. Great performance, plenty of power and AWD when skiing, plenty of room for baggage, great MPG for an SUV, navi system is far superior to GM's Suburban (don't have to put in park to change your destination, etc). Zero problems...just gas and oil changes. One beautiful car...except for the sho-gun shield looking grill.
Navi is easy, hands-free is great, AWD is perfect.
First luxury crossover SUV I have owned. MDX won out over the Lexus, and cost less for a very well equipped base package. Handling, power and ride are outstanding. Back seats are a little less comfortable for my tall teenagers. Back cargo area is very roomy, and easily expandable with 3rd seat folded and back seats down. I drive up snowy, often treacherous mountain canyons to ski in the winter. The SH-AWD system, coupled with the manual shift mode (for descents), is outstanding. The MDX is much better in the snow than 3 truck base SUVs, I have owned previously. 
AWD system, exterior styling, cargo room
This is the first Japanese SUV we have had in a while. Last SUV's were Yukon XL and Envoy XL. This beats them out by far. Performs almost as well as our Mercedes e class but has the utility of our Envoy. We always take this on trips and it is very comfortable. The third row is great for smaller children but not so much for adults. Best SUV so far. No problems within our almost 2 years ownership.
Navigation, sound system, bluetooth, comfort, acceleration, performance, all wheel drive ability.
I have owned my MDX for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on it! It is so much fun to drive; looks & feels luxurious so no problem pulling up to upscale places! I didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so I keep the third seat down & purchased the rubber mat for the back. I have plenty of room while at the same time I am "zippy"; easily pulling into parking spaces and getting around town. I love the navigation system, although it does need updating and the bluetooth is wonderful, although for some reason it keeps unhooking my Treo phone which the Acura people say is the phone's fault. LOVE IT & would buy it again.
Large storage area, hands free phone with the bluetooth & voice recognition is safe. The heaviness of it feels safe and large interior is very comfortable. 
It is a fun SUV to drive. The engine is smooth, the white lights are super bright, the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car behind the wheels. It handles amazingly well in the snow and would likely recommend it to anyone. I just went through a B1 service, oil change and tire rotation, which cost me $56. It seems fair compared to the maintenance on the Audi. We do a lot of highway driving and average 19 MPG and it took about 7500 miles before the service light came on. We have an Accord and Honda USA treated us well. We got rid of our Audi and went with a Honda product. We made the right choice. 
AWD. Excellent car for winter driving. Sound system is great. The best GPS system that I used. It is a good size SUV but it does not feel big behind the wheel and blind spot is minimal. Backup camera is a must. 
I'm a realtor in Colorado and went up to Whale Rock Road in Bellvue to list a home. The owner said I would need chains to get up and down the hills. I took a chance and drove up the hill without any issues, used the manual transmission to drive down the switch backs and snowy, icey hills to "civilization" and the car basically drove me down. When I would've shifted it was already where I wanted it. I generally do not drive off-road and was amazed at the handling capability. This car is quiet, comfortable and stylish with plenty of room. (Love the storage and 3rd row seat when needed). I'm thrilled I have the MDX! Thank you Acura you have a fan, who is living to talk about it! 
Everything! Navigation, stereo, 3rd row seat, storage, comfort, heated seats, the list goes on and on!
I now have over 18,000 trouble free miles on my MDX. It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. Very comfortable on long trips. Performance is even better with a K&N low resistance air filter.
Solid road feel, comfort and mileage for a big roomy SUV
This is by far the best SUV I have owned. Power on demand, luxury interior, gas mileage is all right. It is top quality vehicle, can't beat it.
Rear camera
I picked up the car in Feb and after 1 month of driving I still absolutely love the car. It drives very smooth, I have the dvd player and navi, and both are very user friendly. I am constantly getting compliments on it and I would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! I used to drive a mercedes c240 2005, but this is much much better!
Navigation, dvd, premium leather, wood trim, easy to use features, bluetooth.
Favorite Features
Quality of build. Nav. system and handling characteristics.
This vehicle is very expensive, needs a lot to improve, power steering is very hard, wind noise, low fuel mileage, noise in front suspension.
Exterior & interior design.
This car is quite comfortable, with a 300 hp engine. A unique design inside and out. I love driving this car.

In love with this car! Gorgeous interior, heavy tech features without the heavy price! Did a 7 hour road trip with family. Wife was in back seat reclined back enjoying a movie with our son while I was listening to ESPN XM radio up front. We had their temp set to 78 as they are always cold and I was feeling good around 72 degrees since I am always warm... very nice!! Excellent acceleration and handling. Previous review said they had heavy steering. I do not have this problem at all. This vehicle has surpassed our expectations and I would be very suprised if it doesn't win a lot of awards!! 
Acura's Navigation, bluetooth, interior comfort and design!! Handling, 300 HP, SHAWD!!
I recently picked up my 2007 tech and entertainment MDX on 2-23-07. It has been truly a great purchase. I traded in a 2006 Mercedez-Benz that had multiple problems to an upgraded dream. All of the technology is great. I offer to drive my friends around just so I can feel the comfort of the seats. I am a stay home mom with 2 kids. This car has plenty of room for everyone. I highly recommend it.
The navigation and XM radio.
Just got the MDX. Love it. It is such a great car for me. I have owned two Hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another Honda but wanted more luxury than the Pilot. So the Acura was the answer. It's a great ride, everything I need. I'm a 5'1 female and I love it. I have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did, little guy can get in easier by himself and I use it to buckle him in without stretching.
Back up camera (love it), I'm a gadget girl so all the bells and whistles.
I have had my 07 MDX for about 2 months now, I love the thing from its fun to drive to its looks. Only problem was a loose rear suspension bolt that made noise over some bumps. Dealer took care of that and now its as solid as anything out there. Fuel economy isnt all that great in the city but on the highway its very good. Its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls will be if any. But so far with 2000 miles on it its great.
Stereo is great with that nice sub in the back. Rear entertainment works great also.
I just traded in my 2002 MDX for the New 2007 MDX and am about to trade again! The new car is significantly smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your are driving a truck 3 times heavier. The whole driving experience is that of a much larger car then the old one, but when I get out and look at it, it looks much smaller then the replaced MDX. My wife actually has a hard time parking in small parking lots because of the steering. This is a big negative. The build quality is superb and there are lots of improvements, but be warned the driving experience is anything but nimble.
Interior build, quality, smoothness of ride.
Excellent vehicle. Took it on a cross country trip from CA to NY with absolutely no problems. With highway driving, I get close to 23 mpg, but when driving around town, I usually get about 15 (I drive pretty aggressively I guess). Build quality and design is superb, and the options you get for the price compared to cars in its class is considerable. Only thing that I'd really like to see are flat 2nd row seats, for better cargo storage. But otherwise, excellent :D! I love my car. I've gotten about 5500 miles on it so far in 2 months.
Navigation, although I haven't gotten the voice commands down yet, I feel I'll love it more once I do get that. Bluetooth connection for the phone is super cool. And people always seem interested with the small storage space near the passenger's feet. 
I drove the X5 BMW and the Mercedes ML class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 MDX.This vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like a light jet. The technology is superb. We've put almost 1000 miles on it this month and I can't wait to drive it again
The nav system and voice controls. The interior design is exquisite.
As expected, Acura's attention to detail, outstanding quality and impeccable ergonomics live on. The overall interior quality is terrific. Love the handling prowess. Takes curves like a sports sedan - well, almost. Very good power once over 30 mph. Very smooth suspension compliance but so much that wallowing and pitch/rolls dominate; spot on blend of comfort and handling. Additionally, the navigation system is terrific and easy to use. The upgraded stereo system is awesome, and the rear view camera is great. Leather, sunroof and all the bells and whistles I could want. Comparably equipped X5 was $14K higher - no budging. Bottom line - best SUV available under $50K! 
Interior layout, ergonomics and sporty handling. ELS sound system is beautiful. Vault-like quietness; almost sound-proof.
I was looking for a vehicle for my wife and daughter. I am the kind of guy that will research vehicles for months and months before making a decision. After comparing the MDX with just about every luxury suv (ie, X5, XC90) on the market, the decision became easy. The MDX has a luxurious feel but still has a lot of function to the design. The technology is amazing and easy to get used to (my wife is not a tech geek at all and she is loving the nav, blue tooth, rear view camera, etc.). Very safe vehicle. After all the research I am convinced this is the SUV of the year, when luxury, quality, performance, and Acura's reliability are all thrown together. Best vehicle we have ever owned!!
We love the look. Not at all generic like a lot of crossover SUVs!! We got the ENT/Tech with desert rock metallic and parchment interior. Wife loves it!!
Great style, power, pickup, handling, comfort. Surprised how crips it handles for size of car. Drives smaller than it is. Priced better than competition for same features.
Navi is awesome, very comfortable, drives smaller than it is, great handling for size of car.
This is a very fun and smooth SUV. I have owned it about three weeks, and have the best time driving it. The gas mileage is not the best but I can live with it. Do wish that the roof rails, side running boards, and side body moldings did not have to be extras, but they make the car look so much better.
Navigation.
Excellent ride and lot's of bells and whistles for the price. Safe vehicle great for our growing family. My wife and I are expecting our first child in a few months. We purchased this car so she could have a safe, reliable vehicle that could also be great for kids and have some class/luxury to it as well! Very happy with our MDX purchase! The class leader in our opinion!! 
Very well rounded suv for our family: luxury, technology and safety. Great sound system. No one does navigation like Acura! Great cost of ownership when compared with other luxury SUVs. Smart buy!!
Resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would be driving then it was pretty much her decision. And her decision was just that. Lets go buy the MDX. Now I am a convinced owner of all the quality and comfort Acura has to offer (which if you let my wife tell the story she already knew). It is by far the most superior vehicle we have owned. 
The luxury/sport button. In our quest to find the color and package that we wanted we were told by many different sales reps that the difference was minute. How wrong they were. You can tell a huge difference. I love the sport and my wife is all for the luxury. 
With the exception of gas mileage, the new MDX exceeds my expectations - handling on par with best sport sedans, very quiet, rides better than most luxury cars. Build quality very good. Improved overall from an excellent 2001 MDX. Trip computer very inaccurate - overstates mpg by at least 10%. MPG an actual 20.5 for 2000 mile trip, primarily interstate at 70-75 mph. Surround sound system is excellent, perhaps better than my '04 Acura TL. 
Handling, particularly on curvy, mountainous roads is superb. Overall quietness and excellent ride. Engine power and smoothness - outstanding. MDX is a great value compared to luxury competition.
I also test drove the X5 4.4 and Q7 4.2. The MDX was just right. All the stuff I need. 
Handling, seats, bluetooth, third row when you need it.
Compared with Mercedes ML350, Lexus 350, BMW X5 3.0, Volvo XC90. Better than the ones compared to. With Mercedes and BMW everything is an option. I had a MB S430. I spent too much time repairing the vehicle. MDX comes fully loaded with all options. The audio system is excellent. It plays MP3s of DVDs. It can hold 6+1 DVDs loaded with MP3. 7 * 8.4 GB (dual layer) = approx 60GB of songs... AMAZING !! Quality of audio is also excellent. Navigation rocks. MB navigation is like Mickey Mouse compared to this. I never thought of being so happy of a Honda over the MB.
Audio, navigation, DVD player, 7 seats, etc, Handsfree Link (bluetooth), etc. A lot more!!
I purchased the 2001 MDX Touring when it was first available. Kept it for a couple years and traded it on a Nissan Titan. Now I am back with the 2007 MDX. Wow is all I can say. It's more refined than I remember the 2001. I bought the Tech Package and I love all the gadgets. The leather seems to be better quality. This one seems quieter than the 1st gen. I cannot wait for a long trip, we are planning a trip to Tahoe but there is no snow up there (Feb 1).
Navigation, Bluetooth, driver memory settings, split front armrest.
I looked into BMW X5, Benz M350, and Volvo XC90. I lastly checked out the new MDX and fell in love with all the features the car has and its new look. Definitely the most bang for the buck in every aspects compared to other vehicles in its class. 
Voice recognition (not sluggish at all!), ELS Dolby PL II sound system + XM = pure listening heaven, gorgeous interior, functional 3rd row seat (easily fit 5'10" - 6 feet people), decent engine power, luxury feel, tons of tech/geek oriented features, integrated nav system.
Just took delivery of my '07 MDX sport/entertainment package SUV. Traded in a Porsche Cayenne S. The new MDX is just about as good as it gets. The electronics integration is perfect, as per Acura's usual standard. The driving experience is just beyond reproach for a vehicle with this size and flexibility. The SH-AWD system with the sport package suspension gives you a great combination of pull through curves, precise handling and a smooth ride with the benefit of the sport suspension's active dampers. You can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole lot of fun doing it!! This '07 MDX is truly as good as it gets!!
Electronics integration - bluetooth, nav, realtime traffic, surround sound audio. SH-AWD - WOW!!
Leased '07 MDX 2 weeks ago, have 800 miles so far. With the exception of fuel economy (16 mpg of suburban driving), MDX is very much what is expected from Acura: comfort and good road handling.
Excellent navigation system - tech package is worth it.
Researched the 07 MDX a lot before purchasing. It was worth the wait. The 07 interior is much nicer than the 06. We bought the Sport package and the leather upgrade was worth the price. This car has a lot of pep and wants to go. Can't wait to take it on a trip. The more you drive it, the more you like it.
The handsfree link is great and the sound system is very nice. Very comfortable seats.
I have owned over the past 5 years a 4.4 BMW X5, MB ML500, and Lexus GX. By far this 2007 MDX out performs all the above - in all categories. Handles like a BMW, but with more "toys" and better reliability.
The technology in this auto is leagues above any other vehicle on the market. 
I just traded my beloved Infiniti FX for this MDX Sport. I drove the Acura just to prove to myself that my FX was still unrivaled in the world of upscale crossover vehicles. You gotta understand I loved my FX, but I loved my childhood sweetheart too and then I started meeting real women. Yikes!!! The MDX Sport handles better than top of the line Porsche of my 70s youth. While not the briskest off the line, from 4000 rpm and above this beast will compare favorably with almost anything not in the "super car" category. The blend of technology (too much to tell you about), comfort, utility, fit and finish is unrivaled. Drive one, hear one, and make one go around a corner... then decide.
The most capable automobile entering and exiting the apex of a challenging corner I have ever experienced.
I've had my MDX for about a month now; traded in my 2000 Grand Cherokee. While I don't think this has the off-road capabilities of the Jeep, how often are you really "off-road"? (Once in 7 years for me). The front seats are extremely comfortable and the ride is one of the smoothest I've ever had. Had a big snowstorm recently and I would classify the performance as "decent, but not great." I considered the Q7, XC90 and 4Runner as well. For the price, you cannot beat the standards in the MDX anywhere. Thought about upgrade to to Tech pkg, but expensive and will probably just get aftermarket Nav at some point for way cheaper.
Quiet, smooth ride - handles great and quick on the highway. Exterior and interior design. XM! Memory settings for two. Bluetooth is easy to use. Steering wheel controls are simple. 
Bought the complete Sport /Rear DVD package just before the New Year. I highly recommend this vehicle. It's a blast to drive, stylish comfort and a real workhorse. Safety is a huge reason for owning this newest design. You can't go wrong!
Interior roominess and comfort. 5.1 surround sound sytems brings audio delight. Navigation system is superb!
Wife and I were in market for vehicle with 3rd row of seating. We don't like the large truck-like SUVs and also do not like minivans. We decided to look into the luxury SUV segment and narrowed our choices to the BMW X5, Volvo XC90, LandRover LR3, and the Acura MDX. After test driving all and reviewing the numbers, the MDX was the obvious choice. Unbelievable extras for the money. When compared with these other luxury SUVs, I would have had to pay around $60K to get the same amount of features. Acura navigation currently head and shoulders above competition. Love the combination of luxury, utility, and convenience. 
Navigation, Bluetooth, rear DVD, 300 HP, and AWD.
I have about 1,300 miles so far and do enjoy it. Tested RX 330, XC90, Touraeg and this is it. Acceleration a little touchy at start, maybe software upgrade to transmission needed. Ride is excellent, super quiet, luxurious interior. I purchased base model and has great features for price point. Mileage about 19 mpg with mostly suburb driving. Mine came with Bridgestone Dueler tires with B/B rating, I would expect best quality for this vehicle. You get Mich. A/A when you buy other trim lines. Shame on you Acura. Telescopic steering wheel could go another inch, I'm 6'1" just to be safe.
Room, ride, handling, looks, features, performance. Third seat is fine for children. I added day/night mirror, roof rails and side molding. Looks great!! Aberdeen green is sweet with parchment interior. Brownish wood tone would be good for parchment interior. Great seats all around. 
Amazing on gas for size & 300hp! Ride is exceptional and the gadgets inside are very enjoyable. Love this vehicle! Ride is best in category!
Love it love it love it!!
Good vehicle, good overall value. Handles well, lots of nice technological items inside. High seating.
Comfy seats, navigation, hands-free-link, killer audio plays MP3, WMA & DVD-A, room for 7, engine has lots of power, HID lights
My MDX elite in sport suspension mode will out handle my S2000. The way that the Super Handling AWD works with the magnetic suspension it is like you are on rails. 
One of my many favorite features is the voice activated navigation. so easy to use. 
Great vehicle! Comfortable and sporty ride, easy and very responsive handling (SH-AWD and ADS), very safe feeling vehicle, very good engine power, great Acura ELS Surround sound system (DVD-audio, Dolby prologic II, 10 speakers), very good speech recognition for Navigation, audio systems and Hands Freelink, front and second row seats are the most comfortable we have ridden in. A first class SUV all around with abundant storage and passenger room. Fuel economy on the sticker is very accurate. 
Speech recognition for navigation, audio, and Bluetooth connected cell phones. Very good surround sound system. A pleasure to drive an SUV that has comfort and sport handling capabilities in one vehicle.
Took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the past 3 weeks. Fuel average is 20.1. More quiet, comfortable & fun to drive than the 2004 I traded in. Great sound system. NAV has greatly improved. Really need to read the driving manual. Tried Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 but preferred the MDX ride, features & price. Miss the automatic windshield wipers & hope I never need to replace the "blue" headlights. Highly recommend it.
5.1 surround sound XM stereo, NAV system, sport suspension, blue tooth phone connection. 
I have owned the car for only 6 weeks, and I have experienced the following problems. The right front door started to rattle the next day after delivery. After the door was fixed, the sunroof and the front passenger seat started to rattle. After these were fixed, the dashboard started to rattle. The AC compressor makes a loud thump when it starts, and it can repeat the start-and- stop cycle several times when you wait for the green light. The transmission makes knocking noises when both speed and rpm are low as if it were a 10,000- mile-old transmission. The back of the car produces a click sound when any of the doors is shut closed. The last two problems also occurred in the loaner MDX I got.
Third-row seat, performance, fuel economy.
Comfortable ride although I've experienced a little bit of wind and road noise. 
Spacious. Seats provide good support. Xenon HID lights provide very good illumination at night.
I find this vehicle to be exceptional in design, comfort, and responsiveness. My initial concern of possible road noise was unfounded. Rides very well. Only surprise was the original equipment tires were only DOT rated Traction/Temperature B/B. Disappointing for a luxury SUV. Had optional roof rack and cross bars installed since these are no longer standard equipment.
Bluetooth communicaton technology.
About 3 weeks into my ownership, and I love the MDX so far. It is probably the most comfortable drive of any vehicle I have owned, including luxury sedans. I narrowed my choices to the MDX, Q7 and XC90 and the MDX won without too much thought. And the value is outstanding for what you are getting.
The technology package is a must! Believe it or not, the voice-controlled navigation system actually works pretty well, with no training required. The bluetooth phone integration worked easily, with good quality sound.
I told my wife the MDX had seating for 7, and she said we bought a minivan. I don't think so. With the more aggressive styling, and exceptional handling, this absolutely will not be confused with a van. While not in the SUV class of my old 4Runner, I've come to the conclusion my time spent off-roading is in the past. For the streets, you can't do better. The fit and finish is excellent, there is little road noise, and electronic capabilities (Nav, voice, and sound systems) of the car are outstanding. 
Sound system, Navi system capabilities, integration of voice commands with Navi, hands free and sound system. Styling may not be for everyone - that's a good thing to me in today's look alike world.
Great handling for SUV, plus plenty of room for this class vehicle. The electronics are pretty intense, but learnable and the car is full of amenities. Engine doesn't sound as sweet as most acura/hondas but it has plenty of power. The cabin is very quiet even at speed. Leather seating is quite comfortable. 
MP3 DVD changer, can hold thousands of hours of music! Smooth transmission and active suspension make this drive more like a sport sedan.
This is my second MDX - the first being an '02 Touring model with Nav. Drove it 77,000 miles with no problems. The '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power, more comfort, and improved body styling. The Tech package provides a whole new level of controls that are voice-activated and user friendly. No more touch-screen input. I'm absolutely delighted with this vehicle. 

After a couple of months, of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 Lexus GX 470, I finally wore her down and we (she) reluctantly bought the Acura. One of my concerns was moving "down" to an Acura from a Lexus. I was extremely wrong, this is one high tech machine, the navigation system offers more features, but is much more user friendly than the Lexus, The entertainment package gives the kids the option of listening to their choice through the headphones while the adults can listen to something different through the speakers & handling on this car is unbelievable. You can even set the doors to lock/unlock at the speed of your choice & the remote to open 1 or all doors w/ 1 touch. 
Handling, integrated bluetooth, navigation, manual shift ability.
This is my first Acura vehicle, I previously owned a BMW coupe & am a current owner of an Odyssey. I primarily got this vehicle because of the value that was packed into this model. Comparing it with a BMW X5 (07- 3.0), this was a much lighter vehicle, lower cost & easier to handle. The ride was also quiet and the seats are comfortable. The third row seats' leg/shoulder room is better than the competition. Middle row seats are very comfy for the two outer most, however the middle one is not good for long travel. The driver seat is excellent in holding the driver and power seats have lumbar support. The sound system rocks! Navigation is easy to use & voice commands are very convenient.
Navigation, sound system which supports DVD-A & MP3/WMA playback. Comfy seats for the first two rows. Bluetooth capability. Multi information display showing SH-AWD activity. 7 seats. Very light handling. Little to no blind spots. Proactive safety (DRL, side mirror markers, high seating).
The car is just beautiful. I got the black cherry pearl sport, fully loaded. It's like being strapped into a rocket, what power and handling. The fuel consumption is higher than I expected but I was told that it would take several months before the true fuel consumption is realized, I hope that's true. I love XM and if you love music like I do, I would highly recommend getting the navigation just for this option. I haven't tried the sport driving feature yet and probably will not use much in the future. I got the sport just because of the upgrade in leather. The parchment interior looked too yellow, put with upgrade to sport, the leather looks much softer and not so yellow.
Of course, the XM radio and color. I just love the black cherry pearl
2007 MDX may be best car I've ever had. My previous cars were no slouches: BMW 540i (6-speed), M5, X5, and Infiniti FX-45. I loved all of them! This is very similar to X5 only leaves $20,000 in your pocket. This car has fantastic ride in comfort for most roads, and sports car handling on windy mountain byways. We love the voice controls for Nav, climate and stereo. Stereo is best short of Audi A8 which runs $8,000. If you can find one, buy it loaded! Taupe interior is gorgeous! Seats are sensational! Power is adequate. Incredibly quiet too.
Interior, fabulous NAV, ELS sound is untouchable, quiet, comfort/sport ride choice, quiet,insulation, voice recognition, power tailgate (Entertainment package required), quiet, quiet, quiet.
Just purchased an '07 MDX with Tech package. The more I drive it, the more I love it. Takes some time to get used to all the buttons, features, voice commands, and the GPS system, but the car rides awesome, nice pick-up, and everyone just loves the look of the car. AWESOME! 
I love the lighting in the car - everything is well lit, with nice colors at night. I love the fact that most every features can be customized to my liking. 
I have had my MDX over a week now and love it. Never had an SUV with the power and handling the MDX has. Even in the comfort mode, handles like a dream. Gas mileage has been fair. (17 MPG mixed hwy and city.) Very fun to drive. The navigation system is awesome. Easy to use and many features. Stereo system very impressive. Head lamps light the road very well at night. Seats are very comfortable and the heated seats work very well. 3rd row seats are OK. Great for kids or adults on short trips. The rear entertainment is very nice. Good screen and easy to operate. Wireless headphones give great sound. Would like to have seen the vehicle have a built in phone holder, and coin holder.
Awesome handling and great navigation system. 
This is my first Acura and it sure is a pleasure to drive. Handling, braking are superb and rival my wife's Audi A6. The tech package has just about every bell and whistle you can imagine. 
The navigation system, XM radio, seats, voice activated control options.
Bought an aberdeen green the weekend before Thanksgiving and could not be more satisfied with it. Great power once you get the rpms up. The 5 speed should have been a 6, but it's not a deal killer at all. For me the transmission has taken a bit of time to get used to. I think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and then it really moves. Gas mileage has been between 18 & 19 mpg and that is mostly in town driving. Good for a 300 hp midsize suv. The lack of a dimming rear view mirror is no issue at all. The rear windshield is so dark that it is not necessary to buy the dimming mirror. Love the way the AC/fan speed adjusts based upon the location of the sun!
Simple... the price. The MDX is an incredible value. The fact the the vehicle is so easy to clean. The ext paint, int carpet/leather and other surfaces. Just a damp cloth and pretty much anything comes off easily.
I test drove the BMW X3, X5, owned the Honda Pilot 2006. Once I saw this new MDX I had to test drive it. The SH-AWD really is impressive. It corners under acceleration like nothing I've driven before. I'ved owned a couple BMWs and we just bought for my wife a 2007 328ci with sport suspension. I'm amazed at how well the MDX holds it's own with the little sports car as far as feel and road holding under extreme cornering. Brakes are great. The third row is nice in a pinch for small trips.
The SH AWD is outstanding in a class of it's own. The active damping system for suspension makes this SUV feel like a sports sedan. It really is very enjoyable to drive. Less road noise is much appreciated.
After purchasing I realized this vehicle is very overpriced for the quality you receive. Options such as rain sensitive wipers which were on my 06 MDX are no longer available. Very poor fit and finish, not to mention orange peel paint which the dealer assures me is normal. The vehicle is tight and confining. I think I will trade it in before I lose too much in depreciation. I would have to sum up to say that this vehicle is a very big disappointment.
None.
I'm one of those people who research purchases to the point of exhaustion prior to making a decision. Additionally I test drove all similar vehicles. Nothing, and I mean nothing, compares with this vehicle for the price paid. Everything about this vehicle is top tier, fit and finish, performance, luxury, reliability and safety. I feel as if this vehicle is a bargin even at MSRP! Acura simply has produced a excellent automobile at a great price.
I can't choose just one! It would have to be the combination of safety, performance, luxury and fit and finish. This is a "smart car", very technologicaly advanced. It has a lengthy list of reprogrammable features to customize nearly every convenience and luxury feature to each drivers preference.
The MDX is a very smooth ride, easy to handle and extremely comfortable.
Navigation, entertainment system, iPod option, overall technology
Just picked up mine last week, black on black with Technology and Entertainment. So far I have put in five hundred miles. All heads turn. Drove during Thanksgiving trip, loving the bluetooth and live traffic info. State of the art GPS system.
All wheel drive with three hundred horsepower babee. Great cornering, reminds me of the Acura RL.
Finally a luxury SUV from Acura with good performance. I now have 1000 miles on my 07 and am very pleased with it. It has very comfortable front seats, handles very well for an SUV with good power and acceleration. I use the manual shifting capability a lot and find it very convenient to use. The sound system is excellent. When I first got the car I found myself accelerating to 70 mph to merge with 55mph highway traffic. Then I realized I wasn't hearing any noise associated with the speed and that's why I didn't realize how fast I was going. The Nav and Entertainment systems are excellent and easy to operate. The kids love the larger DVD screen. Thanks Acura for a great SUV!
Comfortable seats, quiet interior at highway speeds, handles very well for an SUV, convenient manual shift, good power and acceleration.
Picked up the car 11/21. Drove it about 300 miles on a trip right off the lot. Very comfortable car. Great side view mirrors, driving position. Custom features impressive - you can design this car however you want. Sound system very nice, navi is the easist I've seen, although the voice commands are a little rough so far for me. Bluetooth is awesome, linked up my phone in minutes. Acceleration is solid, especially in the 60+ range. Averaged 20 MPG in freeway driving so far. Added roof rack - solid metal rack, and sport running boards as well as D/N mirror. Perfect family car. 
Cockpit - and it really is that. Navi is very nice and clear - high up which does not distract. The car just looks good, from any angle. Technology - if you like gadgets, this is your car.
We never thought we would find a better ride than our 2004 Tahoe.This vehicle has a big car ride and handles like a sport car. We have had the new vehicle for a month and we have not seen another one on the road. I would find it hard to believe that there is a better midsize SUV on the road. 
Just about everything.
We test drive different SUVs in its class but MDX has outdone themselves with excellent interior and exterior. While we enjoy driving this, people's heads start turning on the freeway. It was a worth wait to get MDX sh-awd acura advance which has best performance and value. You don't have to think twice before buying MDX because it's got the whole nine yards. Go get it.
We love all the features, especially luxurious cockpit, voice navi, 3rd row seat, very spacious, XM radio with real time traffic, sound system, comfort ride, front grill. It's beautiful and unlike anything else on the market!
I didn't have to test drive any other after I test drove the MDX. I bought the car on the same day. The ride is excellent. I love the interior design. With 300 hp, you will feel that pick-up. I chose MDX with Tech package, didn't go for the entertainment package since I don't have kids yet. Good luck.
Camera when you put it in reverse, Navigation system, Bluetooth, 7 seating capacity, interior design, exterior design, reliability 
My land cruiser was too big, my FX45 was a lot of fun but too small for family trips, hopefully this is just right. Plan to spend a night in the garage learning the new toys. There is room for my wife's luggage, the kids and dad's luggage and the golf clubs. Not as fast as my FX45 but performace is as advertised and does not disapoint. Sport and Ent. package provide the technology and ride quality you want, toys for the kids, room and comfort for the wife and family. The styling is better and more masculine than last year. It looks like a SUV rather than a minivan. Looks better with side step running boards and roof rack.
There is a tremendous amount of technology for the price. There is great versatility and practicality. The build quality is as expected from and upscale honda. the ride quality was better than expected. Bluetooth phone feature increases safety and convenience so much, no car should be without it!
This is my 7th SUV and my 3rd MDX. The 07 MDX is in a class by itself. I shopped other brands. Handling and quick steering response are greatly improved. Interior and exterior are beautiful. The manual shift mode is fun. The driver's comfort and positioning with instruments and gear shift were well conceived. I would have liked to have had items in the entertainment package such as electric tail gait and heated second row seats. 3rd row seats are still cramped. Missing are the automatic wipers, and auto dimming mirror (which didn't work with the privacy glass in the rear). This is a thrilling car to drive and own. I wouldn't trade it for the more expensive BMW X3 or Mercedes.
Style, power, comfort, and handling.
A great car for those that need the third row but love to drive. What really sets the '07 apart for us is the handling on the Sport model. Power is good enough, interior is beautiful, exterior is nice in black. But this thing has fantastically controlled body motion, very little lean, good steering. And the SH-AWD really works, rotating the car even at moderate throttle. None of the ponderous SUV feel, understeer, etc. We are coming from a BMW 528i wagon with a sport suspension, and the MDX is very pleasant surprise. 
Great handling and ride compromise, Sport shocks are great, SH-AWD really works, quiet cruiser with decent mileage.
Very nice vehicle overall, but not outstanding. Acceleration (off-the-line) is not very strong and feels only very slightly better than my previous '02 MDX. Once it gets going (around 3500 RPM) the engine comes to life. Don't see all the hype about SuperHandling-AWD - much better than the old model, but not any better than others such as the new BMW X5. Ride comfort great with the Active dampers! and front seats are excellent! - but fuel economy is a big disappointment - only getting around 12mpg city and 18 mpg highway at 75mph. (I have about 1650 miles on my MDX.) 
Outstanding NAV system, Fantastic sound system (ELS-Premium), Ultra- comfortable front seats, very smooth/quiet engine.
This is a great SUV. I had done my research against Lexus, Audi, Toyota and Honda. This SUV offers a lot in standard features compared to other manufacturers which are all options. This SUV also has the horsepower of V8 competitors all in Acura's new 3.7L V6. This is definitely a light SUV you should consider and put on the list. I love being the only one on the road. The looks I get etc. We got the rare color Steel Blue.
Very comfortable interior and the back up camera is a must. Ecellent GPS system through Acura Link. Booming XM stereo system, puts out 410 watts!
Unbelievable value, the whole nine yards. Build quality, performance, tech features galore. ULEV to boot. I can picture driving this SUV for ten years, it will probably seem state of the art for the first five.
The handling and braking; gorgeous interior.
Picked up this baby on 10/19/2006. Had returned my Lexus RX 330 lease that same day. Compared to the RX 330, the MDX is 6 inches wider, 4 inches longer, and 2 inches taller. But given the size and weight difference, the MDX is almost as nimble as the RX 330. (It definitely much more nimbler than the Mercedes ML class.) The ride is pretty good, but not in the class of the Lexus. If maximum comfort is what you seek, you can't beat a Lexus. Acuras are very German-like, they are built as performance vehicles first and foremost. Luxury/comfort comes behind. The GPS system and controls takes getting used to. (At least for me, because my RX 330 had touchscreen GPS, the MDX uses a turndial.)
Aggressive styling. Fairly large cargo area. (Wide enough to fit golf bags straight across even at the wheel wells.) Bluetooth phone connectivity. XM Satellite Radio Traffic integrated with GPS.
I bought a TL after I had a Pilot, needless to say, I missed the room. I have 2 small children. This is the nicest vehicle I have ever owned. It's powerful, quiet, refined, full of gadgets and so comfortable it pampers you. I'm getting around 23 mpg (90% 75 mph interstate driving). No squeaks, no rattles. Beautiful taupe interior. My only complaint is the lack of automatic rear-view mirror. Acura, thank you!
Navigation system. If you learn the voice commands, you don't have to touch a dial. I thought this would be a problem coming from the touch screen on the TL, but this system is by far better. The speech recognition is very advanced. Love the backup camera and all the texturized surfaces.
Beats every expectation. Fast, nimble, great turning radius, and full seating for 7 when necessary. 
Front cockpit is luxurious. 
SUV handling is exceptional, lives up to marketing hype. Technology is easy to use, however expect a learning curve to master all aspects of manual and voice commands. Third row seating area is of margional use (small children). Excellent power at mid and upper ranges. No early build or mechanical problems noted.
Technology package; climate control; semi-active dampers; and overall ride quality.
From its luxurious ride to its fit and finish - this is truly a luxury SUV.
Drivers cockpit and power.
The prelim reviews were great, and I anxiously awaited its arrival at dealerships. I purchased one the 1st day they were available and have no regrets!!! It's incredibly powerful. After driving a suburban for 6 years, I'm loving this SUV! I've driven some great performance vehicles in the past, and this is definitely at the top.
Where to start... incredible ride! Performance, sporty, technologically advanced! Parents love it, teens love it, kids love it!!
Bought it a week ago in Ottawa, Canada and drove it to Florida for the winter. 1400 miles over 3 days and it worked better than my 03 MDX but with close to the same gas mileage. Larger engine gives it a little more power but the interior fit and finish is the greatest part. Feels like a true cockpit and the Nav System was great. Far superior to the last model. Really enjoyed the XM radio and the sound system is fabulous. The new trip computer not quite as good as elapsed time resets with each stop rather than driver resetting it. Most features were easy to operate, very intuitive. Seats with lumbar support can't be beat and I tried them all. Thanks Acura.
Seating position, Nav and sound system, storage space behind second row of seats biggest in class.
This is the SUV to own if you want an outstanding technologically advanced, fuel efficient car with all the bells and whistles plus some you didn't even think of. In my opinion, the Acura MDX is the best value, best performer and offers the option of 7 passengers where many only offer 5. This is a completely new model with zip and zest that will leave any man or woman feeling lucky to own. I'm glad I waited and didn't order something else more expensive; it was worth the wait. We'll just spend the money we just saved on a family trip to Australia next summer!
The comfy seats, the smooth ride, the navigation system and the high profile front grille, it's bold and unlike anything else on the market!
I love my new MDX, it drives like a true luxury vehicle, very well built, very low wind noise. I absolutely love the engine, pulls like some V8s with better gas mpg. I was a little bit skeptical about trading my 05 for it, but I'm glad I did. Price tag a little higher than expected, but I believe the car will live up to its price several times over, as many of my other honda vehicles.
The 300 hp engine, the navi system, the SH-AWD, and the seats (which are sooo comfortable).
Just picked it up on Wednesday traded in my 03 this is atotaly different vehicle. Power and luxury incredible, rides like a dream. I testeed everyhting on the market and nothing is as nice.
Nav / control system.
Thanks for making a SUV that won't make me look like a soccer mom! What a sleek looking vehicle. Comfort level of all interior controls is perfect. I've only had it for a very short while, but heads are turning. This is by far the best SUV of 2007 for the price and STANDARDS that are offered. You can't beat it. 
Interior design, voice activated controls. comfortable seating, leg and arm space. Extra storage compartment on the passenger side.
Wow, what can I say. Far most better than the competitors, wow. I do have to say that Acura has created the best in the SUV luxury class. The 07 MDX does drive so smooth and very fast that you feel like you are in an airplane, its unbelievable, its incredible. Buy it, you will keep it forever.
Everything.
Bought this a year ago new and it's 13k later. Don't let the 300hp engine fool you. This SUV has much less pick up than my 01 V8 Grand Cherokee which it replaced (I leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage for a larger car (the onboard mile computer is off by the way). Rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much less useful). Also mismatching color bumper is tacky IMO for $45k car (I picked silver body which blends the best). Instrument cockpit is WAY too busy with DVD/nav system (and I'm a techy).
Outside style, pretty interior, good value vs BMW X5/X3 I was also looking at. Beautiful car and we have 3 (!) in our cul de sac to prove it :)
I purchased my 2007 MDX just two days ago and LOVE it! It rides like a luxury SUV but with the kick and sporty attitude of a TL or TSX. The Technology Package blows my mind and I consider myself a "techy guy"! I am thrilled to have this vehicle! 
The Technology Package is by far my most favorite feature of the MDX. From the voice recognition to the rear view camera! It even imports your cell phone address book once you link the bluetooth connection. WOW!!! I also love the cabin as it is very quiet. 
Bought my 2007 MDX with/Tech pack in August 2007. Do not like it. The acceleration is sluggish, and the engine is noisy. The tech gadgets function well, but you have to take 20 hours to read the manual to learn how to use them. The navigation system comes with a very old map and POI database. You cannot find any place built after 2004. The navigation system also does not take latitude/longitude. The $3000 navigation system is not better than a $150 portable.
Highway gas mileage is good, I got 24 MPG on highway.
Between Sept 2007 and April 2008 I had 3 sets of front tires, 2 sets of back tires and it drives worse than my Tacoma! I jumps from side to side over bumps. It's unpredictable on stopping. Honda Corp only tell me they can try and "have it fixed" It's been in 7 times in 8 months! I stopped driving it in June. Selling something to you that is broken then just "fixing it" is unethical. I would suggest that NO ONE ever buy this car!!
I loved the design of this car and am really disappointed it turned out to be the worst thing I've ever driven
First thing I want to say is that this SUV handles better than a vehicle this large and high should. Honda/Acura did a great job with the suspension and driver aids. The interior space is very nice. This car is wider than most of the competition so that translates into more passenger comfort when you have more than two passengers in the back seat. The third row is fine for kids or adults on short trips. I am disappointed in the gas mileage. In the city I am lucky to get over 12 mpg. On the highway I get about 19. Nowhere near the numbers advertised. I also find it pretty pathetic that a $40K+ vehicle has fake plastic wood. I have had panel gap issues. 
Interior comfort. The suspension is a good compromise between controlled ride and comfort. Good power. 
This is my second MDX after surviving a roll over in my 2003. That car saved my life. For comfort, dependability, class and affordability, this is the car for me! 
Love the heated seats, visibility and making u-turns on a dime! Total comfort for all passengers. Plenty of storage space and room enough for those tall friends of ours.
Overall this is a great car. I've strictly driven Lexus for the past few years due to the quality and comfort of their cars/SUVs. This is my first foray with Acura. The MDX is a nice car that is easy to drive, although had I known I would only be getting 12.5 mpg around town, I probably would have purchased something else. Oh, and the back-up camera does not work well if too much light is shining on the back of the car. 

I've owned over a dozen Hondas and Acuras through the years. I must confess this is probably the best vehicle Honda has ever made, right up there with such ground breakers as the NSX and s2000. Honda has simply built an SUV version of the Acura RL. I should know since I also have an RL. In all but the most aggressive of handling maneuvers the MDX matches the RL. It's very quiet with a nice engine growl when revved. Acceleration is good for such a heavy vehicle. Rear comfort for 2 is excellent. The other 3 spots are for children. Cargo space is ample with the rear seat stowed, towing performance is excellent. Competitors may be better in one category or another, but overall none is even clo
Handling is good for a sport sedan for an SUV its superb. The magnetic suspension is worth every penny. Its seats are superbly comfortable and well bolstered for curves. Blue tooth, navigation and enterntainment systems are excellent. The audio is fantastic. All weather capability.
I bought the car on January, 2007, have test driven X5, FX45, and Lexus; however, this MDX has out performed all these others by the quality, luxury, and value. Beautiful car, consistent build quality, powerful performance.
Interior and exterior design, power from the engine, BMW handling.
This suv has everyting from heads up display to nav. I love the mdx. I have taken the mdx on long trips and found the comfort level is 2nd to none. My wife will not fly so all our trips are on the highway. Highway miles per gallon 22-23 mpg @74mph city 17-18 mpg The only problem I find is the gas tank door sticks when cold. 
Navigation (honda), heads up display, leg room (I stand 6'2"), rear cargo area, 300 hp.
I replaced this vehicle for a 1999 4Runner. I also considered the Lexus GX470, BMW X5, and Audi Q7. Extremely comfortable to drive, love the interior and all of the tech features. First class!
Voice command, tech features, bluetooth, surround sound stereo, heated seats, everything!
Love this car!! I have had no problem in the first 4000 miles and am very satisfied with the overall experience with this vehicle. The ride is so smooth and the power is there when you need it. The luxury, performance, and overall looks are worth the higher purchase price.
Navigation, comfort, backup camera, engine and overall ride.
Unlike the previous model MDX I owned, the new design has lost many extras and the bluetooth is extremely poor sounding! The sound is ported through the AM radio and it's extremely poor in the 07 and 08 models. I really miss the rain sensing wipers, the day/night mirror which is now finally included and the open bottom of the steering wheel to rest my hand on long trips. The ultimate insult is that darn Bluetooth. Company in the car just laugh at how bad it is when you cant understand people while driving over 40mph. So much for the "technology leader".
Body style, nav and 3rd row air bags.
We picked up our MDX in June 2007. What a purchase! We compared all of the vehicles in the class and selecting this vehicle over all of the others from our perspective was a no- brainer. Here we are with over 10K miles and we just love this SUV. It is so fun to drive. We got everything on the vehicle. The technology pkg, the performance is unmatched. This vehicle has a powerful engine that truly delivers. We did the head to head test drives with the BMW X5, Porsche Cayenne and other top brand crossovers so the buying decision was very easy thereafter. It outperformed everything. Having had several Acuras in the past, the build quality is simply awesome. One test drive will sell this SUV.
The technology package is very nice. Very roomy interior and quite luxurious inside. Lots of headroom and legroom. The audio system is exquisite. Switchable comfort/sport ride is awesome. Has a very sporty, wide stance that keeps the vehicle on sure footing even when cornering at high speed. 
This is a great vehicle but... in the 8 months I have owned it Acura had to replace the windshield (flaw causing distortion), adjust 2 of the door handles (installed wrong), replace the muffler (broken interior baffle), replace a rear strut (failed), replaced the battery (dead cell), fix the dash and trim (installed incorrectly) and other minor items. Mine has had horrible build quality, although my dealer is fantastic. I bought Acura because we have had great cars from Honda, but this isn't built nearly as well as my wife's Odyssey. But, no SUV out there drives this well. If you are considering, buy the SPORT, it's worth the money.
Bluetooth is FANTASTIC. Nav is good. I like the split 3rd row, it makes it much more functional. The clamshell center armrest is actually really useful. It drives SO WELL. The Sport just sticks like a sports sedan. XM radio rocks. I never thought I would want it, I bought a 3 year package!
Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX, and what a difference. The ride is not as comfortable/quiet as the Lexus but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drove down to FL from NJ, and was so comfortable driving that I drove straight on the way back. The kids loved the Entertainment System that they did not even bother using the game system which we can plug in the truck too. Averaged around 20-21 MPG on our trip, and was very pleased with the good acceleration on the highways. Constantly getting looks hopefully due to its handsome styling. My only complain is that the voice recognition falters. I really enjoy driving this vehicle (which I think drives like a car).
Engine, navigation system, DVD/ES, backup camera, active damper control, SH-AWD, & styling.
My husband and I fell in love with the MDX in 02; bought it and when we needed a second vehicle, got another one in 03. Kept going and got the 07. We wanted a change and test drove the X5. Nice ride but for the bang and the buck, the MDX was the clear winner!! I love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention the way it hugs the curb as I try to see what it can do... wow!! No vehicle is safe but I feel a sense of security in my MDX. Who knows... might be riding an 08 in the upcoming months. I didn't think it was possible to improve on the vehicle but wow... they did!!!
Stability and smooth braking action. Stereo system and navi. Bluetooth handsfree link 
Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX. The ride was not as luxurious as the Lexus, but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drives like a car! Drove it down to Disney from NJ; enjoyed driving too much that I didn't even bother stopping (except for gas) on the way back. The kids love the DVD so much that they did not even use with their game system. MPG wasn't that bad either (averaging 19/21). Overall, I think the build and ride is not equal to that of the Lexus, but they are still within very excellent standards. I enjoy using the manual mode for better acceleration on the highways. Regularly gets looks from people - hopefully because of its handsome styling.
Navigation system, backup camera, powerful engine, entertainment system, active damper control, SH-AWD, power rear hatch, 3rd row, & FUN TO DRIVE 
I upgraded from an original 2001 MDX to this one and am very impressed by the quality and features they've added to the car. Makes my old one feel very bare bones. We did a 1,400 mile road trip over Thanksgiving with the new MDX and loved every moment. Powerful engine, feels wide and stable on the road, tracks well through corners, good sight lines. Very nice. The seats are very comfortable. The front seating areas are a little confining by design. Navi and entertainment systems are both very well done. Cargo space could be a little larger but larger space = larger body = more weight = fewer MPG. So it's not a bad balance as is. Overall I'm very pleased with this SUV.
Navi and entertainment package are terrific though be sure to get trained by the dealer on operation. It can be pretty confusing to get started.
Nothing but problems with all of the new electronics. Nav works when it wants to and always when it is at the dealer. Air bags misfunction... messages pop up dealer tells me to just ignore it. Rear camera works MOST of the time. Entertainment system not working for 5 months. Dealer wants to fix it but doesn't have a clue. I guess service personel will eventually be trained on the new model. I owned and still have a 2005, I didn't test drive before purchasing... what a mistake!
Looks great inside and out.
Bought my MDX in June '07 after testing all comparable w/3rd row seats (X5, Q7, GX 470). For the value, it won hands down. For the same items and options in others would have cost an additional 10-20K. Have 10K miles of city/highway driving, and love every minute of driving it! It's more like a sport sedan than SUV. Ride and acceleration are excellent; seating comfort great in front & back seats. Yes, 3rd row is for kids and small adults, but if you want a full-time 3rd row, get a full-size SUV. They work great when heading out with a few extra friends. No question this is a great combination of value, fun, and luxury in SUV skin. Wife has TL-S - loves driving the X!
Acceleration, sound system, SH-AWD pulls well in all conditions, overall comfort, interior lighting of all controls at night, nav, rear wiper turns on when front wipers are on and vehicle placed in reverse.
Very powerful for its size and drives like a car with the SH-AWD making it feel like one, on the most demanding curves. Brakes are stellar with the brake assist feature and with the stability assist control thrown in, your driving is completely technology assisted. We currently get about 18/23 city/hwy on premium gas. Interior is quite comfortable except for the third row which is best for kids under 4'. Navigation/sound system/backup camera/heated seats and dvd make it a nice long trip vehicle. The center console is a huge bin without any coin holders/small compartments. Road noise is prevalant at times. Tire noise is minimal. Lots of techno gizmos to keep you busy for a while.
SH-AWD handling, Customizable settings for two drivers, audio system, steering wheel controls, navigation system and the dvd entertainment system and the widest sunroof in its class.
I love the comfortable ride and performance. The 10 way power driver's seat combined with the telescoping steering wheel makes it easy to find a comfortable position. My wife and I both drive the vehicle so the custom seat, mirror, radio, and phone book settings linked to each key are great. The exterior styling is a real head turner, much better than the 2006 models. Visibility from the cockpit at night is great. Love the interior styling and dash appearance. Third row seating comes in handy on occasion. The navigation system is easy to use and convenient. Practically every feature comes standard. Back-up camera is a nice plus. 
Navigation system, 300 hp engine, lots of features come standard, comfort, exterior and interior styling, headlight design provides exceptional visibility at night, blue tooth capability.
I tested the BMW X5 3.0 (too small, slow), the X5 4.8 (fast, too expensive!), the Lexus RX (nice, not sporty enough). This vehicle is a big step up from the '02 model: more power, better handling (doesn't feel a bit like a mini-van anymore), more creature comforts and roughly the same fuel economy. Driver's seat is very comfortable for my 5'-11" frame. The SH-AWD system is terrific as you feel it pull you around sharp turns as you accelerate. Nav. syst. has good display and gives clear and adjustable directions (from almost constant advice to concise directions). Hands Free Link hooks up to B/tooth c-phone on startup, sound system automatically switches to phone when called.
SH-AWD is great. The engine is very responsive if a bit rough at hi-rpm. The manual shifter is great for rapid acceleration, engine breaking downhill, and holding the proper gear on uphill grades (a 6 speed would be better). The 3-zone climate control great for warm driver with a cold passenger.
I came out of an Expedition to buy this SUV and was pleasantly surprised by how much more comfortable the vehicle is than a truck based SUV. The horsepower and performance are up from my previous truck/SUV vehicles, and so is the mileage. Those giving the MDX poor grades for mileage are not comparing it to other SUV choices. I regularly get 22-23 mpg at 70-75 mph on the highway. I chose this SUV for a couple specific reasons: I needed a vehicle that could tow my 23' boat and its trailer, but I wanted a comfortable, economical everyday ride, too. The BMW and Lexus didn't have the tow power, or enough room. The truck based SUV choices didn't have ride & economy.
Sporty, but comfortable ride and handling. Comfortable seats.
I love this car! It feels secure & solid; the handling is smooth & the acceleration is strong. The leather seats are comfortable & the sound system is fantastic; great sound quality & easy to use. The nav system has proven to be a real asset. The rearview camera takes a couple of seconds to come on, but gives a good view of whats directly behind the car. The climate control system has been flawless. The power tailgate opens slowly, but works great. I haven't used the bluetooth. The headlights work great too, giving a wide area of coverage. Don't know about other drivers, but I love them! Blind spot on the right rear side, but comfortable w/it now. MPG is decent; 20/22 combined driving. 
The sport mode, sound system, navigation and power tailgate are my favs, but the other toys are really cool too. 
We bought a 2007 Acura MDX tech package more than a month ago. Great handling. Overall excellent interior and exterior. Both navigation and backup camera are great additions. Vehicle is wilder than comparable vehicles so think about parking in crowded garages before purchase. We bought this over competitions because of excellent value and the 7 seat capacity. Third row seats practical only for kids. There is sometimes wind noise coming from the right side when driving on freeway. Have not figured that one out yet.
Exterior, interior design, acceleration/handling, nav. system and backup camera
First and probably my last Acura. Big Honda fan so had high expectations that were not met. I liked the styling and it was fun to drive but overall the build quality and use of cheap materials got tiresome.
Good styling job compared to previous model. Seats and sterio system are really good.
We bought our MDX in May 2007 and immediately took it on a 4 month, 12,500+ mile road trip through the USA and Canada. Mountains, deserts, bad roads and good - we really put this car through its paces and have been very satisfied. The MDX drives like a car on twisty roads even without the sport suspension and the manumatic was very useful in the mountains. Interior space is excellent - we traveled with a baby & all associated gear. The nav system is accurate and easy to use. Highway gas mileage is better than rated (about 25 mpg), but city is worse (about 17). Only mechanical prob is a "clicking" noise when steering at low speed - dealer says they have a fix - have to see.
Handling, mid-rpm acceleration, ride quality, nav system, hands-free phone (should be required by law!), multi-zone AC, 2nd row room, stereo.
So far just getting used to all the gadgets has been a challenge. I really like the feature when you unlock it but forget something and have to go back. You can program it to lock in 30, 60 or 90 seconds after you may have inadvertently unlocked it and forgot. Great security feature. I have taken it on a few long trips and am also very happy with the cruise control especially on steep hill climbs like I have in BC,Canada. I have set it at 80 MPH and climbed a 12%-18% hill grade and maintained it for the 2km hill climb. Awesome!! I actually like the navi control knob that some people seem to hate. 
Navigation, XM radio, SH-AWD, tri-zone climate control, rear heated seats, oil life gauge, Acura owner link website, for about $20000 less you are getting a excellent SUV compared to the BMW X5. My wife is happy!!!
This vehicle vibrates badly at speeds above 60 MPH and has noise issues with rear windows down. Although the performance is great, it corners well, and acts like a big 4X4, it's no fun when the vibration pushes you off the highway. The dealer has not been able to fix the problem and Acura said they have company cars the act the same way. "Live with it!"
The car is a fast all weather vehicle.
Four months and counting in this new SUV We wanted a fun to drive, dependable SUV cut out for city and commuter driving with two kids in the back seat and with the ability to handle snow when needed. I think we got it. Only a couple of downsides so far. The front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - in fairness I'm tall but not that tall. Adjusting the seat to unusal configs helps when the legs start to hurt. And the rear view camera has been useless to us so far, very hard to see in most daylight situations, at least for us. I wish I had the rear sensors instead. 
Navigation is great and handling in Sport Mode is very fun, especially for a guy who just traded in a german sedan to gain the room of the SUV for the kids. SH AWD hold a lot of promise for this winter. 
First the positive - this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. It is an awesome vehicle for sure. The technology is like a science fiction movie, at least for someone like me who has never owned a luxury car before. Everything is easy to use if you take the time to read the manual and practice. There are so many minor details that Acura does right to make this car so much more than just a car. I do have some complaints, though, and they mostly relate to practicality: 3rd row legroom could be better based on experience in similar size cars; 2nd row seat buckles are poorly spaced for booster seats; 2nd row climate control vents do not adequately reach the 3rd row.
Navigation system, voice commands, LCD display size, back-up camera, luxurious cockpit.
I was driving a 2005 MDX and was offered a company car. The choice included BMW X5, Mercedes ML350, Audi Q7 and Lexus RX 350. Given my excellent experience with Acura for the last 2 years I opted for the new MDX. Acura did a great job (interior and exterior). I love the new sporty look. The seats are very comfortable and provide good support. The 300 hp engine does a great job, sound and performance are impressive. I prefer the new navigation system over the old one. The 10-speaker sound system beats my stereo at home! My children love the larger DVD screen (9 inch now). The blind spots are a problem but once you know you are just extra careful when changing lanes.
Super handling AWD (no commercial joke it really is "super"), front seats, sequential sport shift, arrangement of center console, power tailgate, top quality interior layout, live traffic update built into navigation system.
I love this car. I drive considerably on the freeways and side streets for my job every day. I wanted navigation, 3rd row for the kids, midsize luxury SUV. The style is great, so fun to drive and it is the perfect size for my family (3 kids). When I say fun to drive, I really mean I love to drive this car. To soccer games/practices, choir practices, school and preschool drop and pick up. It makes the necessary work and family driving less painful and that is exactly what I was looking for in this car. The upside: smooth pick up (especially at 50 mph+, like a galloping horse), real time traffic on the navi has saved me plenty of time already. My kids love the heated rear seats and DVD.
Navigation (easy to use and the passenger can input addresses while we are in motion. Not all navigations will let you operate while in motion). Love the real time traffic. Auto close and open back hatch. (I didn't know how much I would love this feature). Love XM radio. Easy 3rd row.
I finally traded in my '02 MDX after nearly 6 years of hauling countless kids. I was reluctant to let it go, because it was a great car. When I first drove the new '07 model it seemed too big and I didn't like the grille. I am so happy with that I let that go The ride is fantastic, it's easy to park around the city, the back up camera, bluetooth, and navigation are fantastic. The power lift gate is a great convenience. The driver seat is so comfortable. My kids are in heaven with the rear entertainment system, and I can still listen to my sounds up front. How great is that?
Bluetooth, voice-activated navigation, radio, and heat. Power lift gate, driver's seat comfort, rear seat entertainment system w/separate sound system for radio, too. Color back-up camera, suspension, storage compartments. Well thought out cockpit leaves everything withing safe, easy reach. 
Rear view is extremely limited. Very small side view mirrors and late to upload rear camera do not help. Back up lights are almost useless. The seats become very uncomfortable if you are slender. A seam cuts across your rear, otherwise they would be great. Our 2001 Lexus nav system was better that the one they pack in the MDX. The auto window lock-out locks the driver out as well as the passengers. Our dog continually lowers the windows with his paws, and turns on the heated seats both front and rear. The tail gate is slick, but the rear hatch opening is too small to fit furniture that, otherwise, should fit. The key fob is not intuitive. Take a long look before you buy.
The vehicle is very reliable with a compellingly beautiful interior. The auto-stick is nice while driving in the mountains. 
About 4000 miles now. Never has been to Acura for a single problem. For the money, you get a lot of stuff. Voice recognition is for the birds. Main problem that I didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect, at a good angle for your posture, the head rest pushes your neck down !!! Most uncomfortable headrest in the industry. Acura claims that it is a safety feature, but it only works if you angle the seat back about 15 degrees!!! Mileage is okay for a heavy SUV. Get the sport package - handling is out-of-sight.
MP3 player, traffic on the nav screen.
I've owned a new 07 MDX for a month now, and have driven it close to 2000 miles in city and suburb. Comparing it to my past ownership of a Honda Accord and my spouse's BMW 5 series sedan, I think this is an excellent AWD SUV and I would, with no doubt, buy it again. The audio system quality and navi. are noticeably superior to the bmw's. Easy to drive around family and friends in comfort. Easy to haul luggage and purchases from the local hardware store. Rear view camera is indispensable (IMHO, this should be standard on all SUVs for safety). Minor quibbles: "live" traffic update is not so helpful, I prefer pushing buttons or twisting dials for commands rather than voice.
Audio system quality, navigation system, rear camera, black interior, driving comfort and control. 
The 2007 MDX a superb vehicle. It's truly hard to express how great this vehicle is. The navigation system is intuitive and simple to use. The voice recognition is excellent. The ride is extremely comfortable and the vehicle handles the road extremely well. I can't imagine how well the Sports Package performs. Overall, easily the best vehicle I've owned (compared to Explorer, Jeep, BMW). Highly recommended. 
Navigation system. Bluetooth. Lumbar support.
Huge side blind spots make lane changes a gamble. Uncomfortable seats. Dashboard angled steeply away from driver so in sunlight you cannot see the digital readouts. The 4 dash A/C vents almost close when you aim them to blow air at you. And under powered - if you think the 300hp stat means this car will outperform a 265hp V8, a test drive will show this car powers more like a 210 hp V6 costing $15K less. On the plus side, solid luxurious quiet ride and decent handling. Perfect for soccer moms. Not for inner city driving where you need power to zoom up hills and need to be aware of surrounding traffic in case of quick lane changes.
Build quality and reliability, all the electronic gizmos a car could ever have to keep you entertained for months while you try to remember how to use voice command to activate them, and then wonder why they don't work like they did last time, luxurious looking interior even if seats are uncomfortable.
I bought this SUV early July, and am loving every bit of the vehicle. My family members including myself are owners of 5 Lexus vehicles (2 ES, 2 GS, 1 SC) and I introduced the '07 MDX to the bunch. I have no complaints so far and I love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that I would not be able to get from the RX. I test drove several SUVs (Audi Q7, RX 350, BMW X5, Buick Enclave, Chevy Tahoe, looked at the LR3, GMC Acadia) and nothing came close to the drive and luxury that MDX offered. Navigation and voice commands for nav, climate and radio are by far the best.
SH-AWD (makes all the difference). Best driver comfort and interior layout. Nav and voice command technology. This SUV is the widest in its class and has a lot of room than it appears. Awesome sound system!
Undoubtedly this is the best of its class vehicle with outstanding bang for the buck. I am into 3rd week of ownership, so my experience with it is minimal, but all for now I can observe and suggest that Acura improve the ride with more comfort or sportier. Either be more like comfy Lexus or sportier like BMW. Regardless, my experience is still minimal and as it stands I own an outstanding car.

We absolutely love this vehicle. It fits both of our kids (with car seats), our dog, and several adults comfortably. The memory seats are great, being that my husband and I have almost a foot difference in height. Does not drive quite as well as our Saab 9-3, but definitely more like a sedan than expected. Also like that insurance barely increased (and prior vehicle was 99 Passat).
Navigation (I have no sense of direction so this has been great for me) and the aux iPod player. My husband loves the built in XM - now he can finally listen to the Red Sox here in Philly.
For an SUV I love the way this truck performs, rides and drives. I traded my 2005 TL, which was riddled with fit and finish issues, for the MDX and am very glad I did.
Performance and ride.
I've had my MDX for about 4 months now and it's a fabulous vehicle all the way around. Fantastic styling, very fun to drive and pretty good on gas mileage for it's power and size. All my family and friends want one now lol!
Styling, fun to drive, power, navigation system, bluetooth.
After owning a Honda Pilot and an Acura CL type S, I am a Honda fan. My confidence is being tested with tranny issues on the CL, but we absolutely loved our Pilot. The MDX is a step up at every level. The navigation system, initially appearing complex, is easy to use and very informative once you get the hang of it. The build quality is very good with a few minor issues (one being a ding in the quarter panel when we went to pick up the car). Power is just fine for a vehicle this size, and the interior is wonderful. If we experience the same reliability as we did on our 2003 Pilot, we will be very happy campers.
Nav, 4 heated seats, interior design and quality of materials (except for nav hard plastic buttons), very refined and quiet ride. 
After 15 years of loyal Lexus ownership, I decided to give Acura a try - so far, this seems to be a very wise decision. MDX is a fun drive, fast, sporty, comfortable, and family friendly. 
Quick, smooth acceleration. Excellent audio/video system - we purchased the ENT package and the whole family is enjoying it.
Compared with Lexus 350, BMW X5 3.0, Better than the ones compared to. You can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole lot of fun doing it!! This '07 MDX is truly as good as it gets!! 
Navi., DVD, music system.
I've owned my MDX since October 06, have about 8,000 on her. Really a top notch SUV. Ride and handling are smooth and accurate. The interior design of the car is absolutely stunning. Seats are very comfortable and although some controls not in the most convenient of places, where else would you put them? There are a lot of features in this car. The navigation and voice recognition are excellent as is the handsfree phone operation. The most impressive feature is by far the DVD audio stereo system. The sound that comes out of this thing is beyond description, especially if you have a DVD audio disk. Overall, clearly one of the best SUVs out there today. 
Stereo, navigation, handsfree phone, interior quality, memory seats, climate control is also very good. Make sure you get the technology package. Low insurance rates.
After 3,000 miles I am in love with my MDX Sport. The MDX handles like a sports car. The brakes are amazing. It stops on a dime. Gas mileage is better than expected (17c/21h). Best of all, the MDX moves! The MDX has more features than any other SUV in its class. The MDX won out in our comparison with the GL450, X5, GX470 and Q7. The MDX actually drives like a sports sedan and not an SUV. The same can't be said about the other SUVs we tested.
300 HP engine offers great performance. Sport package is amazing! Best factory navigation system available. Interior is huge and luxurious. Bluetooth works well with Blackberry phone. Power tailgate is more useful than I expected. Huge 2 door center console is convenient. SH-AWD is for real.
I've put 27,000 miles on this car in less than 6 months and I love it. It gets 22 to 24 mpg on average with mostly road miles. Handling, acceleration, and everything is great. My only complaint would be that the seats are not as comfortable as I would like for such long road trips. 
Navigation system and SH-AWD are the two best features.
This car has been in the shop continuously. Driver door rattles, windshield leaks, interior trim was never fastened down, window regulator had to be replaced, steering wheel needed to be completely repositioned - one thing after another. I never thought an Acura would be this poorly built. The engine and handling is great, the interior is cheaply made and slapped together. Gas mileage is poor but it is an SUV. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone. Dealer has worked hard to fix, but the factory sent them a lemon to sell me.
None
We traded my wife's 02 RX 300 that never had one problem for 5 yrs. We wanted something a little bigger. The new MDX has 800 miles and the windshield wiper fell apart and scratched the glass. Also am hearing a series of thud sounds when shifting 1st to 2nd with little to no load. Additional rattles are coming from the rear shock area. The dealer had the car for over a week and found both wipers defective and replaced the windshield. Also replaced the exhaust below the cat converter and replaced rear swing arm spring seat as it was damaged along with replacing the spring itself. We picked up the vehicle and heard the same noise. I'm thinking I should have kept the 02 Lexus.
Good performance and fun to drive.
Like the styling and comfort, but there are things that I missed completely with the test drive. 1) The bottom of the steering wheel feels like a food grater as the sharp and hard stitching sits above the leather, 2) the navigation system is at least 2-3 years behind in features with only 2D maps and ugly text for street names, 3) the AUX input requires an iPod at full volume, 4) the voice recognition is worthless and unusable, it's wrong at least 75% of the time, 5) when you drive in an "unverified" area (my home of 50 years) there are annoying warnings that don't go away without a lot of attention, and the worst, 6) the steering is so hard my wrists hurt when trying to turn a corner.
Styling, driver's seat comfort, highway driving.
Exceeds every SUV I compared to. It either has it better or less expensive. This car has every feature you can think of. The DVD surround stereo is amazing (front and rear can be operated separately by driver). I am having so much fun driving it. My husband is always trying to find a reason to drive it. We traded a '99 Landcruiser and the insurance only increased $100 over the 6mos... WOW!! This car has excellent safety ratings along with an alarm system that cuts off the fuel supply. 
Handsfree link, navigation, voice recognition, power liftgate, rearview camera, driver 1 and 2 memory settings (goes way beyond seats, includes music and much more).
I exchanged the 06 MDX for the 07 MDX. I like the exterior and the interior, compare to the 2006. The only problems is that with this 2007 the bumper front and back are plastic and makes the car look cheap. I do not understand on a luxury $40,000 dollar car they would install a plastic bumper. Also, the car has too much wind noise and the steering wheel is unconvertible.
Favorite features are the bluetooth, the speakers including the subwoofer and wood trimming in the interior of the vehicle.

Suggested Improvements
Just bought this vehicle and it is best I've ever owned. 'm getting 18.5 MPG. For 300 hp, no complaints there. I got the base and added roofrack, crossbars, sport rails and daynight mirror and still came in literally 15k less than BMW, 7k less than Lexus (RX 350). Great ride, great warranty, great afterownership services through Acura. Safest SUV on road, Make this your last test drive and you will buy it; no other automaker can justify the price difference.
Interior design, ride quality, exterior looks, acceleration, brakes.
Recently traded in my Lexus RX 350 for the 2007 MDX. Living in the mountains of Utah I need something comparable to a dog sled. Also needed reliability. Not as smooth as my Lexus, but plenty of power for the steep roads (manual comes in handy). Love the styling. It's the most unique vehicle on the road - some may say unique = ugly! Takes a while to learn the tech stuff. 19 MPG mixed driving, mostly city. Overall, very pleased. 
Bluetooth, navi.
I had written a previous post about the MDX but wanted to reserve judgement until I had more miles on it. We just passed the 5,000 mile mark and the MDX is still the best SUV on the market today IMHO. MPG=20.3, great reliability, comfortable and stylish interior. Plenty of room for kids. A lot of fun for road trips. I have heard people say that the car is too advanced, and I don't really understand that as a negative. The car is very intuitive. I am no computer geek but I have had no problems learning the tech features. If you pay this much for a vehicle, I want all these features!! Get a lot of positive comments about the car. Really breaks the mold!!
Interior, handling, navigation, versatility. Acura name!!
I have owned two other MDXs and loved them. This one is a major disappointment. The steering is tough. The steering wheel is impossible to find a place to grip it comfortably. The joystick navigation is annoying and distracting to use. No touch screen navigation. The rear/side blind spots are overwhelmingly dangerous. You simply can not see out the rear/sides. The front seat feels crowded and I have to crouch down in my seat to see the front of the car. The rear view mirror appears to block 1/3 of the vision of the front window. Overall, a very uncomfortable driving situation. Test drive it for a day before you buy it. A ride around the block won't reveal the problems. 
Automatic rear door, third row seats are nice.
I real let down by Acura across the board. I have always bought acuras, but this is one is a let down. It eats gas like a V8, it is very umcomfortable if you are over 5ft. It is very bumoy and the engine struggles. 300hp feels like 220hp. The center console will have you feeling you about to blast off into space. And the pencil thin steerling wheel feels like a 1980s Car. The third row cannot even fit teenagers at all. It does fell like an suv, it is more like a wagon. And for this price tag you can get an Audi Q7 fully loaded,or even a BMW X5 So i did , A Audi Q7 4.2 premium.
Bluetooth, back up camera, Rear entertainment
I love this car. Driving is so fun with powerful engine and active damper control. I don't regret any penny I spent on this car. Well designed amenities are very user friendly. Improved voice recognition functions are so useful in inserting address on the navigation system. 
Active damper control, automatic tailgate.
I purchased an MDX Tech with the Entertainment pack for my wife last year when it debuted. I love it. I was driving it so often that my wife said get your own and I did 4 days ago! I looked at the mercedes g450 but $70,000 with the options was $20,000 more than mine. I test drove Audi G7, Lexus GX470, Volvo x90, BMW X5, Cadillac Escalade and SR ALL more expensive cannot compare to the MDX. I purchased the Sport/entertainment Black. Quality and reliability 10, it drives like a dream. Great passing acceleration. Best Nav I have seen. The drive is smooth and comfortable. Bluetooth works well with my Verizon Treo700.
The navigation, the stereo system, the iPod link, comfortable, smooth acceleration. The hatch autolift, 7 passenger. Sharp looks. Price is right when compared with competition.
Good car, handles nicely, I expected a little more kick. The car has the technology I need but it may be a little too technologically advanced. My only complaint is that it is the ugliest car on the road.
Technology, voice activated features, pricetag.
Like BMW, Audi, WRX STI, only judge the MDX after it has a minimun of 8-10K miles. Improvements in power, suspension performance, quietness, door seals/wind-noise occur. Fast, smooth, 300 HP. Experience 17-22.5 MPG. Computerized SHAWD/Delphi-Magneto-Rheological Shocks and Michelins, corner like on rails with no tire noise/squeal. Suspension allows powering through steep/fast turns like no other car. ?Comfort Switch? allows MDX Sport a Lexus-Ride (leveling tar-strips!) or in ?Sport Mode?, MDX will exceed any other SUV's handling capability. Min. hydroplaning and goes through snow like tank.
Short-throw brakes, by-wire throttle, self-leveling 190 deg. Headlights. 5-Speed-auto does NOT search; it is always in ?sweet-spot? of gear. Want to play, use ?Manual-Mode? either up or down in gear. Sound system is fantastic, but you must first fine-tune 20 computerized controls to your liking. 
Traded in '04 MDX for this year's upgrade and both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this new vehicle. Somewhat disappointed in the rear view mirror, low quality for the type of vehicle. Great 18" Michelin tires and the superb stereo system is a joy to listen to. Roomy and very comfortable. Just a joy to drive!
Interior design and instrument panel.
We have done 2k miles in our MDX now. Other than increased cornering ability and better brakes, this car is a step back from the previous MDX. The steering wheel is seriously uncomfortable and the centre console hurts my elbow if I am resting my arm on it while steering. The front footwells have poor room. The motor is rough for a luxury car and suffers from a serious flat spot between 4500 and 6000 rpm meaning performance is more theoretical than actual. For the NE the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to flowing over the road so it cannot be trusted at speed. This car may be good on a track for a suv but is seriously flawed as a family vehicle for the road.
Space for size
Bought the sport with ent package in Feb and have already taken 2 trips over 300 miles. Gotten 22 MPG ave about 70-75 on the hwy. In town getting about 16-17. The handling is a dream and plenty of power to spare. Kids love the rear ent and we love being able to let the kids listen to their music while we listen to ours. Kids also love being able to bring the game cube or ps2 and I just love being able to plug it in. Best SUV for the money.
Nav system, ent system/stereo, overall drive from the driver's seat is like a cockpit. 
What a fantastic one. This is our first SUV, and first luxury car. So much difference to driving comfort compared to my earlier Camry. Just feels stuck to road, DVD is awesome, crazy voice commands and GPS is too good to be true, accurate. Too bad I have just one so my wife drives it and I get it only on weekends... something I look forward to the whole week :-)
DVD, voice activation, bluetooth integration.
Just purchased and have not found many flaws with this vehicle at all. Great features, fun to drive, plenty of space, and it looks great.
Voice commands, ability to drive with manual like transmission.
Just purchased our 2007 MDX with tech package... what an amazing car. This car has every feature you can think of. The DVD surround stereo is amazing. This car is actually fun to drive, and the handling is like no SUV I have ever driven (Dodge, Chevy, Toyota, BMW). The turning radius is amazing, take a corner and push the gas and just smile. I have three kids ages 14, 12 and 9 and we have plenty of room. The ease of use with the voice activation system for GPS, stereo, climate is second to none. Acura knows how to build a car! 
Instrument display, voice activation system, DVD surround sound, handling.
I can't believe I am saying this, but I love this vehicle! This coming from a man who wouldn't even consider an Acura product. My allegiance has always been with my Bavarian brothers but this time I wanted to be different, and besides the Wifey got the new X-5. Surprisingly enough my sled holds its own with the X-5 and its horsepower advantage. Especially using my Sports package's features gets me through the Malibu hills quite spiritedly. Enough oomph to pass on the freeways of LA and enough panache to park at your trendy diners around town. It just blends in rather than the opulent massive bohemoths like Caddies and Rovers crowding our beloved city. Overall, the SUV is a fine vehicle.
Sport and Tech Package!
This is be our third Acura MDX and they have messed up a great vehicle. From what used to be smooth revving motor we now have the refinement of a mid 80's buick 3.8v6 and I am being generous. Yes the car can handle but at a price of crappy ride quality, the comfort level on the sport suspension is like driving a pogo stick and the sport setting is ok as long as the road is smooth. Interior fit and finish looks to be GM level, the exterior fit of various bits is not up to current detroit levels. The steeering wheel is asinine with lumpy bits here and there to grab and the bottom of the triangle means there is nowhere to hold when turning a corner. If I could return it I would.
Seats.
Traded in our '06 honda Pilot for an '07 MDX, the difference between the two was obvious from the moment you drive off. The MDX feels planted on the road with minimal roll, good acceleration. I'm very pleased with my purchase and feel that it was a definitive upgrade from the Honda Pilot.
Bluetooth, sh-awd, xenon lights, seats.
Bought my MDX a few weeks ago. S far I'm having a blast with it. The technology is awesome and driving is fun.

Bought the vehicle in February, nimbus grey with taupe interior. We were in the market for a SUV with a third row that doesn't feel heavy to drive and we have the near perfect combination in our X. We have put close to 3000 miles in it. Loving it so far. Being a tech geek, it has kept me grinning everytime I take it out of the driveway. Can't wait to take it out on a long trip. I have become a shameless show off after this purchase. Our son loves the entertainment system, I love the ELS stereo though I still haven't figured out the speciality of DVD-A. My wife loves the navigation and everyone is happy. 
Voice controlled navigation, bluetooth, entertainment, rear view camera, keyless memory settings.
This is a full sport utility vehicle and a luxury car combined!! It rides like (even better than) my Lexus ES 330 and it still does the job for skiing, surfing, and road trips!! This car fits 6 adults in real comfort. You could easily do 4 adults, 2 kids and a dog on a long road trip and nobody feels cramped. This vehicle is awesome. Took a 600 mile road trip and several coastal drives so far. Do get the cooler to keep your beverages and food cold so you don't have to stop and buy food (helps offset the cost of the gasoline) . I know it's not eco-conscious, but it is the most fun you can have for the money and still feel like a star pulling up to Spago.
Interior cabin design/comfort. Rides like a luxury car.
Having owned two Toyota 4Runners, a Lexus RX 300 and a 330, and having test driven the 2007 Lexus GX 470 and the BMW X5, I can say without a doubt that the 2007 Acura MDX - my very first Acura - is the best SUV I've ever driven and much more fun than driving a car.The SH-AWD system alone is worth the price of ownership. The first big snow will make you smile because you'll feel safe and secure, knowing you'll get wherever you want to go. Actually, the SUV handles beautifully any time of year and Acura reliability means it won't be in the shop every month. The interior is classy and elegant. Comfortable and intuitive, it's the best SUV I've ever driven. 
So much fun to drive; terrific surround sound stereo system with the tech or sports package; the aux jack make it iPod ready; the Nav is simple to use and Bluetooth works wonderfully. Best of all: the SH-AWD system that is right up there with Audi's Quattro system. 
Car drives very nice and is quiet compared to other Honda vehicles using the same platform. Features (tech and entertainment pkg) are well thought-out and appeal to those who can appreciate new technology. I only have 1k miles on the clock so it's still too early to tell how the MDX will hold up. Michelin tires are very quiet and handle well. 
Rear DVD keeps the kids incredibly quiet, rear backup camera is a nice feature. HID headlights are definitely brighter with a more defined pattern than halogen. ELS stereo really sounds nice too. Front and 2nd row seats are extremely comfortable.
