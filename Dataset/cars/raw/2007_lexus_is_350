What a car. Traded an 05 BMW m3 that was in the shop 7 times after only 26k miles. This Lexus is just as fast but more comfortable and has better interior and ergonomics almost 2 years and has been trouble free. I enjoy the fact that I can just drive and not repair. Backseat is a little tight but I do not use them. Good performance from the engine but still gets good gas mileage. 
Styling, dependability, 27 mpg on the freeway @ 75 mph. 
This is an outbound review of my car which is due back after almost 3 yrs of leasing. I'm still in love with the car's stunning looks, performance and reliability. I never gave the IS250 a chance and now, after 3 yrs of higher insurance premium and lower MPG I wonder if the extra $6000 on the MSRP were worth spending.
The powerful engine, looks, handling and reliability. Keyless entry and ignition, smart HIDs
I really love the exterior design of this car. Probably one of the best looking cars ever. The interior is immaculate, everything flows and the touch and feel says 'solid and upscale'. The 350 is like a gazelle ready to spring. The IS-f must be a cheetah then. Immaculate build quality and leading edge technology keeps this machine running with the pack even after 3 years.
The navigation system is big, bold with beautiful colours, love the blue tooth and Mark Levinson stereo. The car is fast off the mark but well balanced. You have to love the back up camera. This is a must these days.
I love the powerful engine of this vehicle. Almost 2 years driving it and its horsepower/torque still amazes me. The overall ownership experience has been great. No recalls, no mechanical issues, no headaches.
306 reasons to love this engine. I think a more instinctive transmission could get a little more out of his masterpiece. Rock-Solid build quality. Keyless entry. Smart HIDs. 
I bought the car about 18 months ago and it still brings a smile to my face. I think it is a nice combination of luxury and performance. The 306 hp engine still amazes me that this much power comes from a V6 without the aid of turbos. The performance will surprise you. The car is comfortable, and I couldn't be happier with the Mark Levinson stereo/DVD player. It has to be one of the best factory stereos I have heard to date. The backseat is cramped but I hardly ever use it. The ride is comfortable but still sporty. If you are looking for pure sport then you may not be happy. This car has a nice overall feel for everyday driving, with plenty of sportness to bring on the smile.
Great build quality and a lot of extra touches you won't even notice at first. Excellent Mark Levinson stereo. I can't say enough about the power this V6 puts out.
A great car that combines luxury with sportiness. 306 horse power and still making 24.5 avg. MPG is pretty nice. Fun to drive and handles well. A great bargain compared to BMW where leather and navigation are options. This car is built and designed very well. No regrets with this purchase.
Naviagation and control center screen is nice. Perforated soft leather seats heated and cooled air.
I love this car. It has all the bells and whistles or a luxury performance car has to have. Corner steering and high speed braking is next to none. Response to speed is also something that wowed me. Steptronic transmission makes it a much more fun to drive. Navigation system rolled out is the best and map light design is with driver in consideration.
Steptronic transmission, pedal shifters, power mode, rear view camera, push button start, keyless entry and secutity, memory seats, heated and ventilated seats, voice activated functions (almost all including radio).
The vented front seats seem to have little effect for cooling. Don't spill anything on the vented seats. It may be absorbed into the seat. The stock stereo has a very good midrange, but the base can be boomy and distorted. The ride is kind of odd. I feel the road and the bumps, yet I feel uninvolved. There is significant understeer at decent speed. The VDIM is intrusive, kicking in well before there is any real danger of anything. The VDIM can only be turned off by holding the off button for 7 seconds when the car is not moving. Very annoying. If you have any back pain, even rarely, driving this car can be hellish. I used to love driving. I expected I would be happier with this car.
Good color choices. Very nice interior, other than the seats potential lack of comfort. Lots of power and a very smooth automatic transmission. Keyless access is great. Reliable.
The beefy 306 HP engine & excellent handling make the IS 350 super fun to drive. It's solid and quiet with amazing power. Great design both in and out. We don't even have to take the keys out of our pocket! Walk up to the car and it opens; push the button and the car starts. No more keys clinging & clanging everytime you take a sharp turn. Navigation system ties in nice with air controls, sound system, Bluetooth & the built in backup camera are super cool. Interior of the car is sweet with the maple trim and super cool dash light startup sequence. Overall, it's really a great car. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a reliable, safe, powerful and luxurious ride!
Handles well, built solid, keyless entry / ignition, backup camera, ac / heated power seats, great power and sleek design!
I've had my IS for about 3 1/2 months and I have to tell you that I simply love this car! It is extremely fast, yet still has that luxurious lexus ride. In my opinion it is the perfect blend of performance and luxury. The car has definitely converted me to paddle shifters as I really, really like them. Shifting is super fast and allows you to keep your hands on the wheel. I got the sport suspension package on mine and I would highly recommend that you at least test drive the car w/the sport suspension as handling is far superior to that of the standard model. Also the push button start and key fob system is pure genius! I unlock, lock and start the car w/o taking anything out of my pocket.
Push button start and general key fob concept, paddle shifters, sport suspension package, excellent interior lighting, overall styling of the car. I can't stop looking at it
Really, night and day between the IS 300 which I used to own and the new IS 350. Quite a dramatic change in all aspects. Extremely comfortable with premium leather and ventilated seats for cold and hot weathers which I thought it was very nice. The Mark Levinson stereo is amazing. The V6 306HP engine hard to match and fun to drive. I feel this is the perfect car for someone who wants a sporty but yet luxurious sedan who is not afraid of the roads. I thought German cars were unmatchable until I tried this.
306 HP engine. Premium ventilated seats (heated and cooling seats). Voice/touch screen navigation. Bluetooth nice handle.
I like almost everything about this car. It is very fast and handles very well. By the way, my other car is a 2006 Corvette Z51. So, what I mean is that it feels almost as fast as my vette, but without all that torque. The interior is very nice and the leather feels very good. Fuel consumption isn't great. I am getting 17 MPG mainly in city driving, but I don't care about it. It's hard to get a fast car without consuming lots of gas. There are 2 problems so far. There is an annoying rattle in the dash and the front wheels get dirty really fast! I mean, all I need it to drive for 20-30 miles and they are black and dirty already. The backseats are small, but we seldom use them. Highly recommend.
Speed, nice ride and handling.
Had to trade in my 328, way too many electrical problems, a BMW sorepoint . The Lexus has been bulletproof. Sure, handling is not as sharp but it rides a lot better, my wife doesnt complain on bumps anymore, actually have to fight to drive now, wish we could afford another one. Back seat is a little tight. I guess thats what the ES 350 is for. Controls and ergonomics very easy to use. 
Reliability, powerful and still gets 25 mpg on freeway .
I've always wanted this car. I had a Highlander and 4Runner before but this car, I wanted it to be MY first car with my name on it. I'm so happy and glad I waited until this year to buy it. Drives amazing and stops very quickly - I've only opened it up to 100 mph so far; can't wait to open it up to 160 mph :0) I love the technology built into the car. If you're going to buy a Lexus, buy it with all the options.
306 hp, Bluetooth, backup camera, XM radio, DVD/sound system, ventilated/heated seats, voice activated navigation (still learning the commands).
Put 2,200 miles on this car in first 90 days. What a great vehicle. Traded in an Audi A4 2.8 Quattro and have no regrets. Build quality, performance, design and aesthetics are excellent. I keep discovering more fun features and controls with voice activation and the NAV. Also got the XM radio built in for listening to the BBC World Service everywhere.
Performance, build quality, fabulously quiet interior, interior LED lighting, the way the door well lights up, push button start, great stereo, etc.
This car is a blast to drive! Enough electronic gadgets to keep you entertained during the longest traffic jams and enough power to pass whatever gets in your way. I think that Lexus did an excellent job blending sport and luxury together creating a vehicle that is superior on the road. I would recommend this vehicle to anybody interested in the Infiniti G35 or BMW 3 series.
The adaptive HID headlamps are perfect. The telescope steering wheel is a great idea and great for impressing your friends. The Nav. is superior to any I've ever used and the paddle shift makes this car very unique.
I previously had the 2007 IS 250 model for 4 months and then I sold it to my Mom who didn't care about the lack of power from that model. I am now a happy camper with the 2007 IS 350! LOTS of standard luxury features at a great value! Power is definitely not an issue with the IS 350 as was the case with the IS 250 - the power in the IS 350 is there at all speeds and RPM ranges. The brakes are also much better (and bigger) on the 350 model. Handling is good, though probably more enjoyable if equipped with the sport- tuned suspension pkg. Fuel economy has been averaging 17-18 mpg (compared to 21-23mpg with the IS 250 model). For the extra money, get the IS 350 - it's worth it in the long run!
Push-button Smart Access, heated/cooled front seats, HID/AFS lights, 18" wheels, standard radio has good sound, good looking car inside and outside, tight build quality and plenty of POWER from the 306 ponies under the hood!! 
New owner at this point. I am a driving enthusiast and chose this car for its performance and handling. In that regard, the performance and engine come across perfectly. Acceleration is awesome and handling is tight. I'm not quite sure where the "unconnected" steering criticism comes from, I feel that car is very responsive. High speed performance is particularly nice. What I was surprised about is the level of features and refinement. The car is loaded and everything feels well thought out. The primary shortcoming is in the small back seat. A car of this size could have more room.
Acceleration and handling. The NAV system is also very intuitive.
Just traded a 2005 BMW 330 convertible, all hype and a lot of discomfort seats are uncomfortable, ride is harsh, entire interior is cramped, doors are heavy. Lexus: excellent packaging of features including superior sound system, friendly to use navigation system, bluetooth function, rear camera, satellite radio, heated and cooled front seats plus front passenger memory retention settings. Combine the above with a 306 V-6, 6 speed auto and/or sport shift with steering wheel paddles and the overall package is very appealing to enthusiasts as well as just around driving.
While not perfect, the power train mates with an excellent transmission. Ride is surprisingly performance oriented while providing an enjoyable Lexus level of sound supression and comfort. Option packages are comprensive and fairly priced, modern and easy to access and utilize.
My car is 4 months old and it needs a new transmission already! I want Lexus to buy this car back from me! What else can I say about the car? My other car is a BMW 3 series and there are a lot of thing BMW does better than Lexus. Lexus not remembering the seat settings when you open the car is lame. Not being able to use the nav while driving is lame (my passenger wants to use it, Lexus!). The clearance in the driver's seat is too small. For some reason, the passenger's seat has more headroom. Not providing a full sized spare is a cop out. My car has the sports package and I have to say that the 'aluminum trim' on the console should be aluminum and not grey plastic.
Very fast car that handles well! Wonderful Levinson stereo! Bluetooth adaptive xenon headlights
Picked up an '07 IS 350, NAV, ML, Sport. Unloaded my '05 BMW 330i w/ZHP. Needed an auto due to phone and traffic issues. IS is quiet, comfortable, firm, and way too fast! BMW suspension is sublime, and I do miss that aspect. But the navi/ML system is amazing; the Bluetooth convenient; yadda yadda yadda. No regrets.
306 hp; Levinson sound; whisper quiet interior; relative exclusivity.
Just went from S2000 to IS 350. Nav is great. Performance was much more than I expected coming from the S2000. Great acceleration and sticks to the pavement in tight turns. Not your dad's Lexus. Wife loves the automatic and I love the paddles. All driver controls very user friendly. Would like a little more leg room in back seat. 
Nav. Driver controls. Paddle shifters and Mark Levinson stereo. 
I have always driven pickup trucks. Since I've gotten married, we found this vehicle. It was the first car I've ever been able to make a successful u-turn. The handling is awesome. The IS 350 also has extremely comfortable seats. 
I love the navigation system. I was looking for a certain hotel. If there was no map, I would have been looking for days. 
The Lexus IS 350 is a great performance car, but if you want a spacious ride this car is not for you. I am 6'3" and if I have the driver's seat as far back as possible I will not fit. It does have the best performance and luxury in its class though. Overall, the Lexus IS 350 is a very fun car to drive.
Bluetooth, navigation, 306 hp
Overall the IS 350 is just about as perfect as a sports sedan can be. It is a true blend of sport and luxury. The car handles like a dream and looks great sitting in the driveway or crusing on the highway. The brutal acceleration on this car is simply astounding. No wonder this car has been rated with one of the ten best engines in the world. Drive an IS 350 and you will see how fantastic it is.
Loads of power and tourque. Brutal acceleration even at higher speeds. Interior quality that is above just about all other "standard" manf. Fantastic navigation system (when you can use it). Better seat comfort than the 3 or the G. You can turn off the vdim system and let the car perform to the max!
Despite tough competition, there simply isn't a better car for the money. I spent months looking at the competitors. The performance of this car will knock your socks off, it's just a thrilling car to drive. A test drive in the pouring rain sold it for me. The advanced electronics keep the car on track even when pressed hard in the rain, yet you feel totally connected to the road. The build quality is tops and Lexus has been attentive to every detail. It's a beautiful powerhouse, with the best navigation system out there. Everyone that gets in my car drools, it's just that nice. The paddle shifters in this car trump much of the competition as there are dedicated up and down shifters.
Engine - knowing you can take just about anything that pulls along side you, paddle shifters, Nav, VDIM make RWD feel like an AWD!, appearance, build quality, value, cooling seats, adaptive headlights, push button start, quality of leather, feel of steering wheel, stock sound system is amazing.
My wife and I spent a lot of time researching and test driving cars before making this purchase. When we started the search, she had her heart set on a 3 series BMW. We drove all of the usual suspects on several occasions before narrowing it down to the BMW 330i and the Lexus IS 350. Because my wife spends most of her day in the car, comfort was a big factor. The Lexus blows away the competition when it comes to interior design, style and quality. It is evident the second you get in. Lexus takes interior comfort seriously. As far as driving, this car is awesome. 300+ HP and a sport package makes it really fun on back roads. I recommend this car to anyone I talk to.
Heated and COOL seats. Black leather with stainless trim looks great. The navigation system helps with sales calls.
I have this car for about 1 month and so far I am loving it. It is very fast! I have the standard audio system and I like the sound quality. Make sure you get the Navigation System. It is awesome! I researched for about 2 months and I am confident that I made the right choice.
Navigation System + Voice Recognition and Keyless System
The 2007 IS 350 is worth every penny. It out-performs the competition in speed, handling, comfort, and design. It is a joy to drive 40 miles to work every day. This car is by FAR the most bang for your buck anywhere in a car at this price point. The cabin is quiet. The ext and int design is sexy & sleek. The fuel economy is amazing for a 310hp engine. And you can't find many cars that burn the road like this puppy. The speed paddles are a joy to use, and the overall build quality of the car is unsurpassed. If you are going to buy a car in this class, this is the one to buy, bar none. 
Speed paddles. 310 hp engine. The sleek design of the interior and exterior. Comfortable seating
I just picked up my 2007 IS 350 (Black Saphire Pearl) with DVD + ML, 18" Wheels. It is an absolute pleasure to drive. My earlier sports sedan was a 2001 Audi S4. The Audi is an excellent vehicle, but did not have the refinement of the Lexus. For the money -- the Lexus has the performance, refinement, and build quality. For the money this is an oustanding value.
DVD +ML
I have owned my IS 350 now for one week. This has certainly been the best car that I have ever owned. Having test driven the usual suspects looking at the major features of a car, I found a few differences that really swayed me towards the Lexus. One major part of my decision was the interior of the car. The Lexus interior completely impressed me with the luxury, the fit and finish, the quality of materials, comfort and the appearance. The interior is the one area where the Lexus was in a class of it's own compared to all others. 

Great car, PERIOD! Style, comfort, and performance all in one package for a price even some of us military folk can handle. There is no need to go for all the extras. Didn't go with the navigation package with the super stereo and back up camera. The stock sounds are great, the nav package is over-priced, and a back up camera? This car is made to go in one direction, and FAST. Great acceleration! Tight steering with good feedback. Even if you are not in the market, you owe yourself a test drive in this car, what a blast! 
The cockpit wraps around you. The keyless feature is cool, but takes getting used to. 6 speed transmission, with paddles in the wheel. The acceleration is fantastic.
This is a great car! The only downside is that it's no BMW. I traded a BMW in for this knowing that the ride would be a lot more "soupy" than that of the tightness of a BMW and I am a little disappointed I was right. The car itself though is all LEXUS and is a fastastic car from a reliability and creature comfort standpoint. When I am not driving fast and weaving in and out of traffic I am glad I bought it. If Lexus wants to truly go after the 3 Series consumer they will have to find a way to make the car "harder" with regard to responsiveness and road affect.
Bluetooth phone and keyless entry/start.
This car is for my wife. Got it for about a week. Bought it for Lexus reliability, good performance, good handling from rwd, and good review. The car does fly fast, stable, and offer comfortable seats. I feel the rear seats are reasonable size for me (5'8") and my kids. I do not know why Lexus put such a lousy stock stereo in such a nice car. My wife has no interested to spend additional $3000 to upgrade the stereo and a few other luxury add-on. We have not got used to the keyless entry yet. It causes us a bit stress.
6-speed trans, style, comfortable seats, really good handling, and rear-view camera.
My wife and I purchased the new '07 metallic black with black interior IS 350 and are absolutely thrilled with not only the car, but the customer service that Lexus is recognized for. We were between the car we purchased and the BMW 330. We truly enjoyed both cars, but when it came to comfort, style and functionality the Lexus outperforms. The BMW is your ultimate sports sedan, it handles and brakes better than the IS, however, the navigation system is terrible, the seats are uncomfortable and there is a little drag off the line. Our 350 wants to eat more pavement and push even faster when cruising along at 80 or 90 mph. When I buy a German car it will be a Porsche, everyone has a BMW
Keyless entry and push start. If you get the memory seats you can program the keys to that individual's preferences. So when my wife parks the car and locks the door, when we come back to the car and I decide to drive you grab the car door handle and the seats and mirrors adjust to your settings.
I just picked up my 07 IS 350 w/X Package and I am impressed. Car is very well optioned at a fractional price compared to my other car E55. Lots of power for such a small car, Navigation is superior over the Benz's one. A fun car to beat around on a daily basis. Highly recommend the X- Package for anyone who is looking into getting the IS 350.
Sport tuned suspension is a MUST, backup camera is cool, bluetooth is marginal but my favorite is the front air dam, illuminated scuff plates and the X styled 18" wheels.
The IS 350 has everything you could want in a car - speed, looks, and luxury - all for a great price. A comparable 3 series would cost thousands more, and in my honest opinion, this car trumps the BMW in both exterior and interior quality. I purchased one in Obsidian black and I still can't take my eyes off it. Trust me -- this car is worth every penny.
